jessie-salt-vbox-vagrant
========================

This Packer template creates a basic Debian Jessie based VirtualBox image provisioned with `salt-masterless`.  Once build, the resulting artifact will be a Vagrant box with a minimally configured server, including basic firewall rules.

For details on what is provisioned, refer to https://github.com/mohae/saltbase.
